PunchTrack

PunchTrack is a compact, wrist-worn punch tracking device designed to measure and stream live motion data for real-time punch classification. Built around the ESP32-S3 Zero, it leverages the LSM6DS3 IMU for motion sensing and uses wireless UDP communication to send data to a computer for machine learning inference.

üîß Hardware Components

ESP32-S3 Zero ‚Äì Main MCU with Wi-Fi support

LSM6DS3 ‚Äì 6-axis IMU (3-axis accelerometer + 3-axis gyroscope)

3.65V LiPo Battery ‚Äì Rechargeable power source

TPS61023 Mini Boost Converter ‚Äì Boosts battery voltage for stable operation

TP4056 USB Charging Module ‚Äì Allows safe USB-based battery charging

üß† Firmware & Functionality

Developed using ESP-IDF in the Espressif IDE

IMU data is fetched via I2C using burst reads for efficient streaming

Data is enqueued and transmitted over UDP sockets to a host computer

Python on the host side classifies the data using a trained Random Forest model

Key Concepts Learned

I2C communication and device addressing

FreeRTOS tasks, queues, and real-time data handling

Burst reads (multi-byte sensor data fetches)

UDP socket programming with ESP32

Python scripting for network data parsing

Real-time ML classification (Random Forest inference)

üìà Future Plans

Replace I2C with SPI for faster data transfer

Design and fabricate a custom PCB for compact integration

Improve model performance with additional data and features

Add OLED or LED display for onboard feedback and stats
