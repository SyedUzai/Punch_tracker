# PunchTrack

**PunchTrack** is a compact, wrist-worn punch tracking device designed to measure and stream live motion data for real-time punch classification. Built around the **ESP32-S3 Zero**, it utilizes the **LSM6DS3 IMU** for motion sensing and employs wireless UDP communication to transmit data to a computer for machine learning inference.

## üîß Hardware Components

- **ESP32-S3 Zero** ‚Äì Main MCU with Wi-Fi support
- **LSM6DS3** ‚Äì 6-axis IMU (3-axis accelerometer + 3-axis gyroscope)
- **3.65V LiPo Battery** ‚Äì Rechargeable power source
- **TPS61023 Mini Boost Converter** ‚Äì Boosts battery voltage for stable operation
- **TP4056 USB Charging Module** ‚Äì Allows safe USB-based battery charging

## üß† Firmware & Functionality

- Developed using **ESP-IDF** in the **Espressif IDE**
- IMU data is fetched via **I2C** using burst reads for efficient streaming
- Data is enqueued and transmitted over **UDP sockets** to a host computer
- Python on the host side classifies the data using a **trained Random Forest model**

### Key Concepts Learned

- I2C communication and device addressing
- FreeRTOS tasks, queues, and real-time data handling
- Burst reads (multi-byte sensor data fetches)
- UDP socket programming with ESP32
- Python scripting for network data parsing
- Real-time ML classification (Random Forest inference)

## üìà Future Plans

- Replace I2C with **SPI** for faster data transfer
- Design and fabricate a custom **PCB** for compact integration
- Improve model performance with additional data and features
- Add OLED or LED display for onboard feedback and stats
